# Executive Summary (See HTML for full report)
Diamonds are graded based off the 4Cs--color, clarity, cut, and carat, which are the industry standards for assessing the quality and value of a diamond. Out of the 4Cs, carat size has the largest impact on the price of diamonds in the current market. Our study found that for a 1% increase in carat size, you can expect diamond price to increase by nearly 2%. Moreover, the data lacks evidence supporting claims to "buy shy" (i.e., buying diamonds with a weight slightly below the closest half and whole number carat for the best value) because we see an exponentially increasing price as carat size increases, without any significant steps in price at .5 and 1 carat increments.

Considering the other elements of the 4Cs, Blue Nile claims that cut is the most important, although we found that cut does not have a significant impact on diamond price. While there is some discernible difference in price across cut grades for very small carat diamonds, cut has a diminishing effect on price as carat size increases, with no discernible difference in price between cut grades for larger carat diamonds. We found that the impact of color on diamond price has an opposite effect--color has an increasing effect on price as carat size increases. This leads to a small carat diamonds being similarly priced across color grades and larger carat diamonds having a significant difference in diamond prices across color grades.

Blue Nile claims that clarity is less important than a diamond's cut or color, but the data suggests that clarity has a larger impact on diamond price than either cut or color. In general, higher clarity grades are associated with higher diamond prices across carat size, with the effect being more pronounced for medium to large carat size diamonds. However, we found that VS and VVS grade diamonds are similarly priced across carat sizes, contradicting Blue Nile's claim that VS and SI are the best value for diamond clarity.
